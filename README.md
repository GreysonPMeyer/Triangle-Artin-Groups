# Computing Fiber Products In Pursuit of S

  Fiber_Product_Visualizer.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that can be used to compute the fiber products necessary in the construction of the set S for the triangle Artin group A_{2,3,8} from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07063. The relevant graphs are represented by the variables sigma_W, Y1, bY1, Y2, Y3, bY3 and Y4.

  To run the notebook, please enter the following, one at a time, into your terminal:
  1. git clone https://github.com/GreysonPMeyer/Triangle-Artin-Groups.git
  2. cd Triangle-Artin-Groups
  3. pip install -r requirements.txt

Then open the Fiber_Product_Visualizer with Visual Studio Code or another Python interpreter. The notebook contains explanations and usage examples for all of the functions it contains.
